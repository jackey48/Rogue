# Rogue
2022 ICS4U Final Project by Matthew Sullivan and Ka Hei Chan <p>
Early Schedule for getting started

May 11th - Prototype Done <p>
UML - Done with the prototype <p>
May 13th - Main Algorithms found <p>
Testing - Try all our Algorithms<p>
 
Folders contain the builds top down as they were submitted. Movement build is version history of only the tile map and graphics. Combat build has the main UI without functioning parts but with working combat and levelling. Eventually the builds were combined into full prototypes which are ordered by number. <p>

 Algorithms contain code intended to be used in the program while Design Ideas contained the end concept we wanted and what systems we could have used to make it.
  
  // Contained useful ideas but ultimately not what were looking for
