Basic movement: Draw player on 0,0 with size # x #

public class GameUI extends javax.swing.JFrame {
Graphics g;

    public GameUI() {
        initComponents();
        g = jPanel1.getGraphics();
        jPanel1.paintComponents(g);
    }
    
On window form {
  g.paintPlayer(0,0,#,#);
}

On key press right{
  //Read by position 2D array as [1][0]
  paint player at position #,0 with size # x #
  repaint player at 0,0 with nothing
  
  //2D arrays can only be read as whole number, equation to seperate x and y coordinates found
  %200 gives x coordinates, removing x then /200 gives y coordinates
  

}

Inventory functions as a 2D array containing strings that are the items, string contains two substrings, one of it's name and one of it's bonus
Program parses for second part when reevaluating stats. Clicking on a radio button checks whether its a sword or armour then changes the values appropriately.
Armour and weapons are tied to a value in the array so it knows where to look.
